These reports were part of the Energy Data Science course at TalTech.

As part of the [Report 1](https://github.com/kacperfin/energy-data-science/blob/main/Report%201/Energy%20Data%20Science%20-%20Report%201.pdf), I:
- Described the energy production data
- Cleaned the data
- Explored the data
- Created new features
- Explored seasonality patterns
- Performed seasonal decomposition

As part of the [Report 2](https://github.com/kacperfin/energy-data-science/blob/main/Report%202/Energy%20Data%20Science%20-%20Report%202.pdf), I:
- Described the energy price, energy demand and weather data
- Cleaned the data
- Explored the data
- Analyzed the distributions of the variables
- Performed transformations on the variables
- Created new features
- Ranked features by relevance
- Created ARMA-family models to forecast energy demand
- Compared the two ARMA-family models with a naive 7 day lag prediction
